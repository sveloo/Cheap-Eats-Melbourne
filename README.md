![Part of the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree](https://img.shields.io/badge/Udacity-Front--End%20Web%20Developer%20Nanodegree-02b3e4.svg)

Developed for Project 5 of the **Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree** by Sanjeev Veloo.

## Overview

This is an interactive map of the most popular Cheap Eat restaurants (Under $20 bucks) in the Melbourne city area. It pulls in restaurant reviews from Yelp. These reviews are display in a Google Map infowindow which are accessed by clicking on the restaurants in the list or the corresponding markers on the map. The restaurants can also be filtered by their cuisine. Pretty cool app, especially if you're on a budget and still looking for great food!

## To Run
